🌇 Sundown Studio (Clone)

A pixel-perfect clone of the official sundownstudio.com website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created to leverage and demonstrate my frontend development skills, focusing on replicating advanced layouts, animations, and interactions using only vanilla technologies.
