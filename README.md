🌇 Sundown Studio (Clone)

A pixel-perfect clone of the official sundownstudio.com website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created to leverage and demonstrate my frontend development skills, focusing on replicating advanced layouts, animations, and interactions using only vanilla technologies.

> 🔍 Note: This is a personal learning project and is not affiliated with the official Sundown Studio.

🎯 Purpose

CSS3 — custom animations, transitions, layout styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) — interactivity, dynamic content behavior

🖥️ Optimization
